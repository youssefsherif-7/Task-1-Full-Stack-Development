# Task-1-Full-Stack-Development
This is my first project in my training program in Valero Summer 2021. I demonstrated my application on Nodejs, Express, and MongoDB. 
The requirements were to create a web application for blogs that should have a basic frontend, a database, and a server that would link them all together.
